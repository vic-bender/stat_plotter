# Poisson Stat Plotter
This is a project that I created to familiarize myself with the matplotlib suite of statistics visualizations. Specifically, the variables generated aid with visualizing a Poisson distribution.

Contents:
- stat_plotter.py (main application)
- output_plots.png (sample image file, saved after running program with default array)
